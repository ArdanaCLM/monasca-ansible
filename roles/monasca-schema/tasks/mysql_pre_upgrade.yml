# NOTE(gyee): prior to stable/rocky, Monasca DB schema was a wild, wild, west.
# In other words, there was no "official version" of the schema. It was
# left up to the vendors. In stable/rocky, Monasca established an
# official version of the schema, and it was stamp (or fingerprinted) with
# each migration step. We need to update our scheam to align with the
# official stamp prior to the upgrade
