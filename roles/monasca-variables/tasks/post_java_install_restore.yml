# Suse rpm install of 'java-1_8_0-openjdk-headless' removes CA certs file
# symlink. For SSL interactions, we need that CA cert file at that location
# i.e. /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt. So these steps are added to
# restore those changes occured as part of rpm based java install.
#
# This can be included in any task via following step.
